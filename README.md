# Netflix-Data-Cleaning-and-Analysis-using-SQL
This project explores Netflix data to identify trends, analyze ratings, and provide insights into viewer preferences.  

## Project Overview:  
This project explores a dataset of Netflix content to identify trends, analyze viewer ratings, and provide insights into preferences based on various factors such as genres, ratings, and content distribution. By leveraging SQL queries and Jupyter for analysis, this project aims to extract actionable insights that help understand Netflix’s content strategy, viewer engagement, and content distribution across genres, countries, and time.
